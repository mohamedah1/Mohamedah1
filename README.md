# Mohamed Ahmed

I am an aspiring software developer who specializes in working with the java language and HTML/CSS/JS. 
I am experienced in full stack development and familiar with Spring and Spring MVC Framwork.
I have received a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. Along with my degree, I completed a bootcamp, The Software Guild, 
which teaches full stack development and database management. 

I chose software developing because it creates new and creative challenges with every project. The satisfation that comes along with
getting a code to work that you have been struggling with is absolutely thrilling. I also enjoy being a part of a team and growing together
to create applications and make an impact.
